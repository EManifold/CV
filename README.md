## Ellie Manifold

After completing a few online courses over a year ago, my growing passion for writing elegant and well-structured code motivated me to quit my job in marketing and dive into a career in software development; the satisfaction I got from building and creating things outweighed any reservations I had about a career change.   
   
I’m confident the skills I developed from interacting with others and producing strong results in a team in marketing, combined with my knowledge of HTML, Ruby and JavaScript will make me a capable developer.   

### Skills

#### Communication
Having worked in client-focused and energetic positions over the past few years, I believe this really developed my communication skills. From taking clients on viewings, to liaising with agents, to producing high quality collaborative code, I have a proven track record of delivering results in a team environment. 

#### Problem-solving
What drew me to coding in the first place was my attraction to problem-solving; breaking down a problem into smaller parts and working on those individually in order to solve the problem as a whole. 

#### Independent learning
When beginning my journey into software development I went from not knowing how to write a single line of code, to building my own multi-page website, with authorisation, a question forum and editable commenting only a few months on. I could not have done so without a strong work ethic and passion to learn.
