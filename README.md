## Ellie Manifold

After completing a few online courses over a year ago, my growing passion for writing elegant and well-structured code motivated me to quit my job in marketing and dive into a career in software development; the satisfaction I got from building and creating things outweighed any reservations I had about a career change.   
   
I’m confident the skills I developed from interacting with others and producing strong results in a team in marketing, combined with my knowledge of HTML, Ruby and JavaScript will make me a capable developer.
